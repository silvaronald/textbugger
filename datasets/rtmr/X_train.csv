""" auto focus "" works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era"

empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either .

the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date .

blanchett's performance confirms her power once again .
"delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity ."
