The question of whether EM radiation can be treated as a classical EM wave or as a collection of photons is entirely dependent upon whether the number of photons collected in a measurment is large or small. If its large, then the classical treatment (i.e. spectral radiance over infinitesimal frequency bands ) will apply. Planck's law as stated in the article, calls  a spectral radiance, which immediately implies a classical EM wave, no reference needed.  Photonic emission is for any EM radiation where the number of photons collected is small, including Planck's law in certain cases. """"Broadband"""" means the radiation is spread out over a relatively wide bandwidth, """"narrowband"""" means it is not. Broadband is not necessarily photonic, nor is narrowband necessarily classical EM. Its not a matter of how spread out the radiation is, its a matter of how many photons are collected in a measurement. Broadband can be classical EM if many photons are collected, narrowband can be photonic if only a few are collected.

"Jxm, I inserted the phrase “purporting to examine” back in January.  I believe it is the most appropriate phrasing because:

1.  PEAR only claims to be examining psi, legitimate scientists don’t think that there is any psi to examine.

2.  Even if telekinesis were real, PEAR’s experiments wouldn’t have proven its existence anyway because of their methodological flaws.

3.  The reliable sources seem to be suggesting (though not outright stating) that PEAR was probably involved in deliberate fraud.  The fact that one of PEAR’s own staff was an experimental subject who had a significant effect on their results coupled with the fact that PEAR’s results are not reproducible seems to have created some suspicion.

While I’m not proposing that we add PEAR to one of Wikipedia’s lists of hoaxes, I don’t think that it would be appropriate to use any language that might give the reader the wrong impression.  The mainstream seems to regard PEAR not as honest but misguided bunglers, but rather as malicious pseudoscientists who started at their conclusion and worked backwards.  We should avoid asserting that PEAR actually studied telekinesis in Wikipedia’s voice.  76.107.171.90",0

And as for the subitility: the Slovaks had 0 to 4 duputies in the 420 members parliament (not 4% but 4 persons), and in practise they were prevented from voting on ethnic grounds. That is the only thing that matters. Not only the voting system was bad, there were no free elections even at that bad level. The non-free elections had both political and magyarisation reasons and they must and will be mentioned here.

OK...somebody help me out here...but can you tell who really 'won' this war by reading the article in its entirety? Be you Jew or Muslim or Pagan...I challenge you.  No! You can't.  Even  though we (meaning anybody with an IQ of 20 who has been reading 'USA Today' for the past few years) all know the IDF got a bloody nose, of sorts in this campaign and surely weren't boasting about how things went.  

...the fact that the IDF got a smack down by Hezbollah should be clearly stated in the main article.  It isn't...which reflects the ongoing, glaring weakness of Wikipedia in general: factual accuracy plays second fiddle to concerted efforts to rewrite history by collective entities.  This 'Lebanon War' Wiki entry is a classic example of this.  Israel clearly lost this campaign, but you can read the entire article and really not know who won.  

...what a disservice Wikipedia is.  It is almost pernicious, as this medium is so easily hijacked by special interests who pervert the truth to serve their own special interests.

It appears that the current article on representative democracy propagates misinformation and limited thinking on what """"representation"""" and """"democracy"""" are all about by limiting the idea to elections.""",0

 2006 clean up 

Hi Yboy. I've given a jolly good hacking to the 2006 Commonwealth Games article. The diffs won't tell you much but the before and after is quite a difference. Basically, I've done some general clean up, put things into a logical progression, and hacked off a few things into sub-pages. I created the  template as a navigation between the main article's sub-topics.

I've also given a complete clean up of the category system (:Category:2006 Commonwealth Games). Everything should be easy to find and this is definitely a style worth applying to the other Commonwealth Games. I also rebuilt Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games from scratch because it was a pile of crap! Hopefully, the 2006 can show a good rough model of what the 2010 one should be like.

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.

This movie is the best example of how bad mouthing India gets you accepted in upper echelons of Indian power establishment. In a country where married men are more than twice likely to commit suicide than women and where domestic violence is literally legal against men (and not just by wife but by anybody who wife supports), this movie goes out of its way to invent an abusive husband and then justifies murder by his wife.

And it gets accolades as a 'thought provoking' piece and 'realism' by people who have no idea about real India.talk",0

 Epidemiology

For a start off, you might want to try spelling the word correctly. And your points are extremely POV, for the following reasons:
If it is correct to use the term """"re-took"""" for what Argentina did in 1982, after a gap of 150 years, then it is also true to say that the British """"re-took"""" the islands in 1833, after a gap of only about 50 years.
The Argentine claim was considered valid by whom? The Argentines themselves no doubt, though certainly not by the Falkland Islanders or the British government. This is pure POV.
To claim that the Argentine invasion of 1982 was not violent is truly preposterous, and grossly offensive. What would you call hundreds of armed foreign soldiers landing in your home and forcibly taking control?  """,0
"Dipole selection rule - removal of apparent inconsistency 

There is now an apparent inconsistency in the article as to why no spectrum is observed in molecules with no dipole. The intro says that a permanent (non-zero) electric dipole moment is required to have a spectrum, but the spherical top section says that spherical tops have no spectrum because there is no change in dipole moment with rotational quantum number. A reader may wonder why change in dipole is not mentioned in the intro. 

I understand that this inconsistency is only apparent, because the statement in the intro refers to a molecular frame of reference in which a dipole is constant (at least in each quantum state), whereas the statement about spherical tops describes the rotation of the dipole vector with the molecule as a change in the lab frame of reference. But this is not mentioned in the article, and I think it would be unnecessarily complicated to explain properly. Instead I will change the language in the spherical top section to conform to the intro.",0

Change the aforementioned pages to reflect only the given name and change the subject of this talk session to be the same.  Would you say that is correct?

You know, it does, as I ponder it, make a great deal more sense to use the name and the various titles held in peerage, or otherwise under the person's given name.  There are tons of examples in every direction.  

So I see a basic three tiered approach.

I enjoy refining documents to be more clear and include the """"much"""" additional insights found on Wikipedia and link to them.

The above paragraph illustrates that the axis to this entire debate is your misunderstanding of WP:SELF. More specifically: your mistaken definition of """"reference"""".

You, however, choose to define """"reference"""" very liberally, and take it to mean that Wikipedia should never include anything about Wikipedia, which of course is silly. 
Somehow you've come to believe you are the last word on what is and is not relevant, despite press coverage and vast consensus to the contrary. McCarthyism is alive and well on Wikipedia.

Again, NK never existed as a region before 1920s. While Nagorno translates as mountainous, it was never a separate region. And NK as a region is separated from Armenia by Kelbajar, Lachin and other districts of Azerbaijan. The sources above do not say that NK existed as a stand alone region historically. Even Russian imperial administrative divisions such as Jevanshir and Shusha uyezds included both mountainous and lowland parts of the region. So we need to clarify that NK as a region did not border Armenia. If we are talking about geographic region of Karabakh, then its mountainous part extends right to the border with Armenia, however upper and lower Karabakh historically formed a single region, and geographic concept of Karabakh includes both highlands and lowlands. The history of NK as a historical and political notion starts in 1920s, when it was artificially carved out of Karabakh to become an autonomy for Armenians.

The motor, blades, etc. is no different. Refer to the section """"Bases for Comparison"""", subsection """"Height of the fan relative to the ceiling"""", for more info on huggers if you're interested. That section details their sole disadvantage; it is appropriate for it to be in that section since it is not a problem unique to huggers (though all huggers have it).

 SUKI (tm) and other stuff 

Whether or not you believe in SUKI (tm) is hardly the issue  a debate had evolved on the Talk: Suki page, and irregardless of the outcome, evidence was placed both for and against the existence of SUKI (tm) as a major world religion.  I personally am neutral on SUKI (tm)  I have heard of it in my travels to Japan and on the west coast of North America, have good reason to believe its a religion, but not being versed in Japanese culture, I cannot be entirely sure.

Someone had gone into that page and injected the phrase, """"SUKI (tm) is fake"""", without signing the comment, and without appending the comment in an appropriate place.  I reverted such edit on the basis that it was innappropriately added, and not on the basis of content.  If the person who believes (through his/her comment) that 'SUKI (tm) is fake', then such person should offer some evidence constructed in a fashion that is at least consistent with other comments on the page, appended to the end of the discussion.

The simple criteria for terrorism generally seem to be intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared. Some users would rather use recent acts of terrorism as a yardstick, rather than using a firm definition, and hence lose their ability to discuss matters calmly.

There was nothing particularly interesting/controversial about Chaplin's cause of death. The infobox does mention that he died aged 88, so most people probably already understand from that that he died of 'old age'.

"You are quite right that it is *usually* the underlying image that is copyrighted. If you make a perfect sketch or photograph of a Francis Bacon painting, that will be covered by the same copyright as the original painting. But for these coins, nobody owns the copyright to the actual coin. What the British Library claims is copyright over their picture of a coin. If the coin was two-dimensional we would just ignore them and add a  copyright tag. But because it is three-dimensional (so the lawyer said, but isn't an oil painting too then?) we can't do that. But we can sketch their photograph because the sketch is not going to be the same as the original picture. It certainly all seems very odd to me, but I am not a lawyer.

Hiya. I originally followed this controversy in PC Gamer (my god, back when printed magazines were worth a shit), so off the top of m yhead I didn't have any sites.

One page I found while googling that mentions the controversy is http://www.langston.com/Fun_People/1996/1996CFM.html  another is http://lists.samurai.com/pipermail/bryans-list/1996-December/001811.html  apparently the programmer who inserted this easter egg was fired.

User:Bgwhite: I am surprised that Ontario's """"Reverted to a neutral version"""" edit (of course, it is neither a reversion nor neutral) was seemingly at your request.  If I had known I would have asked you to revert it instead of doing so myself (Dec.6), which has now brought me an accusation by Drcrazy on ANI of """"edit-warring"""".  My first priority is to get Ontario banned/blocked and the current forum for that is the ANI incident.  Until that is finished I do not intend to spend time elsewhere, most especially because I don't want to give anyone on ANI an excuse to say """"OK, they are discussing on the TP so there is no more need for this ANI, we can close it"""".  I am also surprised that you fell for Ontario's spiel on your TP and choose the """"PR in the broader family"""" section.

When one speaks of God, it is generally the Father who is referred to; that is, Elohim.  All mankind are his children.  The personage known as Jehovah in Old Testament times, and who is usually identified in the Old Testament as LORD (in capital letters), is the Son, known as Jesus Christ, and who is also a God.  Jesus works under the direction of the Father and is in complete harmony with him.  All mankind are his brethren and sisters, he being the eldest of the spirit children of Elohim.

 First, I don’t want to silence flat Earth believers in what they say; however, I would like to point out what is said might be biased or flawed based on some reasons. NPOV should address all aspects of the issues no matter how small it is.  If someone makes a statement, there can be counter arguments. Wiki doesn’t have section A devoted to supporters and section B for proponents; therefore, the statements of both can be discussed in a fair and even through out the article. So is it not appropriate to have point counter point within the article?  Fair question, not trying to troll, but deserving a fair answer and if this is not the case then I will re-re-re-read the NPOV stuff.  But if it is allowed then the line that is in debate should stand as somewhat similar to the way I wrote it.

From my standpoint you are the confused. I'm looking at it in the 3rd person. What the alliances were in this ancient time is unclear. Fact is that the Britons were in an anti-Angles coalition and the Angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. If the Britons had contact to the former Roman Empire is unclear but possible. They lived under Roman rule for centuries and were romanized. This defeat was something like de-romanizing to them after 500 years of Roman rule. This can clearly be seen when you read and understand the Roman Britain-Anglo-Saxon battles in Germanic Wars.,0

Ever thought about """"Soviet Jews"""" phenomenum?

Real Russian people were killed only as """"rivals"""", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!

P.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental... And, of course Soviets, who protected their counry agains the invaders were regular victims of WAR, not the HOLOCAUST itself.

I'm ambivalent on this particular issue. On one hand, the content doesn't convey direct information on Muhammad and is therefore not essential to the article. Consensus matters, and clearly there isn't consensus on including this image, and so it should be out. On the other hand, I'm strongly offended by the view of some Muslim editors here that Wikipedia should in any way adjust its presentation to be """"Islamic"""". While Islamic law may prohibit Muslims from depicting Muhammad, non-Muslims shouldn't be pressed to follow Islamic customs. Naturality in the spirit of civility, even non-Muslims shouldn't engage in presenting works or content that denegrate Muslims or Islamic customs. This image however does not seem to be intended to denegrate Muhammad or Islam in any way, and therefore it's unreasonable for Muslims here to be so agitated by such images. The image shouldn't be included, in the end, since there isn't consensus. I'm not happy with the idea of giving into fundementalist muslim mentality though.  """,0

The homepage of the Anarchist Internatonal, www.anarchy.no , is not nonsensensial. Try to prove it and you will fail. The article Anarchist International on Wikipedia is objective and to the point. 

The organizations/networks associated to the Anarchist International are found at the link-page of www.anarchy.no , and then there is a big network of networkmembers/subscribers related to the different organizations/networks.

As for Zazaban I have problems with taking him seriously. In a discussion on Anarchism.net he answered with the following """"intelligent"""" and a bit ochlarchical statements: 
""""You're one to talk. - And, just to see how you react; FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. FUCK FUCK. FUCK."""" Source . I would not put too much weight on what he means. I don't think such comments are funny.

That's not what I heard. I read somewhere that the verses were about Beyonce but from years earlier. at the time of Kingdom Come, Beyonce was 25, but the verses refer to the girl being 23.

They are clearly back together in Kindom Come, and the song could have been from a rough patch in '04-'05. Both theories are possible and should be included in the article

To explain, Turco-Persian is not ethnic it is cultural. Since you clearly can not understand that. Read the first sentence again. 
The lead, which typical nationalists have such a difficult time understanding, states, """"The Sultanate of Rum or Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, was a medieval(time period) Turko-Persian('culture), Sunni Muslim(religion) state in Anatolia, originating from the Seljuk Turks(ethnicity)."""" So to clear it up so you can understand, Turko-Persian is cultural, which is proven in the article under the section CULTURE. 
""""Even when the land of Rum became politically independent, it remained a colonial extension of Turco-Persian culture which had its centers in Iran and Central Asia.""""  Istanbul and the Civilization of the Ottoman Empire, Bernard Lewis, page 29.

I've really done my own level best to avoid adding neologisms, that is, words that I haven't seen someone else using somewhere else before.  But sometimes it's considered a neologism to introduce a term like """"truth-bearer"""" into a context where other terms have been more usual.  What can ya do?

Paleolithic Europeans seem to have been a homogenous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and then expanded into Europe during the Mesolithic period

This is false. I cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that Palaeolithic Europe was genetically homogeneous. If there is one, it would require in-line citation. I think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. The studies have, rather, shown that Mesolithic Europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion. The bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous Palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently.",0

If the pronoun refers to a noun and you can say what this noun is, then by definition it's not a dummy pronoun. My contention is that (maybe) the verb is really impersonal, i. e. its subject is truly a dummy word, not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot.

The definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately, I know; it just covers what I think are the features of what linguists call """"dummy pronoun"""", based on my amateur experience on the matter. I know it's not completely wrong or misleading, though it probably needs a different form. The glossary definition above, OTOH, is a bit too vague, but in any case, note that the very first example of dummy word given below in the source is the it in It is raining.""",0

I WAS ARRESTED FOR HELPING MY LOVE FIND FREEDOM

I love Persa Zula with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my being. I cannot contact her any more due to a court order insisted upon by her father.
If one thing is learned from this, realize that one person CAN make a difference if they are willing to go all the way and sacrifice every thing.
I have done and WILL CONTINUE TO DO this for Her in every legal way possible.
She and I tried to live within The System. There is no escape. The elevation of minors ot adult status is termed """"emancipation"""". For slaves a century ago, reaching a free state meant freedom for life. Persa herself has driven my car TWELVE THOUSAND MILES in search of this.
she needs your support more than ever. It is AGIANST THE LAW for me to directly support her now.

 Q factor definition in the context of individual reactive components 

In the context of individual reactive passive components (e.g. inductors & capacitors), I'm familiar with the following definition: 

The aforementioned definition is presented, in some form, in section Individual reactive components of the article, however, the section Definition of the quality factor has no mentioning of it. Instead, the following definition is presented:

a definition which is practically the same as the other energy-based definition in the section, and furthermore, includes a reference to 
James W. Nilsson's Electric Circuits 1989 edition. I've went through a recent (much newer) edition of the book, and found no energy-based definition of any kind for Q - whether for resonator circuits or individual components.
I therefore tagged the reference as """"Failed verification"""", and additionally, I wonder what is the point of this definition, which is practically the same as the previous one in the article. It seems to me that one of them is superfluous.

Problems with recent edits by Jucifer
1. Time of engagement. He writes it was 2 years. http://www.lchaimweekly.com/lchaim/5761/656 says 5 years. This needs to be looked looked up someplace. 
2.About his receiving degrees, the old version is more npov. In the smae document from mentalblog, he writes """"Laufer (citing one of the rabbis who heard it from Soloveichik himself and a Kfar Chabad rabbi who heard it from associates of Soloveichik) says that even though Schneerson did not spend much time at his studies, his marks were always higher than Soloveichik's. Moreover, """"the rebbe was known to have received several advanced degrees in Berlin, and then later in Paris."""" 
3. Jucifer edited the document to say that the degrees were announced in 1928, and then debunks this by saying that in 1935-1938 he was someplace else, not saying what happened until 1928. This needs to be clarified.

Hi, Oda Mari. Long time no see. I hope all is well with you and that you're having fun editing. I've stopped editing here and moved over to a Japanese film-specific wiki. (There are several reasons for my departure. The main one is that I believe, Wikipedia's """"notability"""" criteria makes all non-English, non-mainstream film articles easy targets for deletion, unless they have been extensively written about in English.) Unfortunately, so far, the editors only consist of a native English-speaker (myself), and (I believe) a native Czech-speaker. So, with no native Japanese-speaker, we sometimes have to wrestle with the Japanese language a bit ;-) A question has come up at:

You can do a """"See also"""" within a footnote to accommodate a note in a note. And you certainly can have expository footnotes that explain the text more. I just read through the article again, and I think it may have gone too far in the whitewash direction: for example, it's ok to say that she clarified her educational background and have a footnote, but the footnote ought to say what was being clarified - this way is too vague and not at all clear that there was some obfuscating going on. Similarly, saying her """"role in a potential Giuliani administration"""" and not saying (even in footnote) what was controversial, I think is misleading.  There may be a few other places too.

In the Wikipedia site for Wembley it says that the tournament wasn't played between 1972 to 1975. So the tournament winners for London that you have for those years Winners Năstase 1972, Okker 1973, Connors 1974, Dibbs 1975 - were at some other London tournament.

"Amirite Article 

Hi Greg Jack,

I saw what you put in the Amirite Article Debate

Only some of the articles I have quoted are Press releases. This one for example is certainly not a paid release: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/share-opinions-online-amiritenet-amirite/ Makeuseof is a very well known site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakeUseOf

I don't think the killerstartups article is a paid release since it doesn't mention adversarial on it. Also Amirite's twitter has over 62,000 followers which is significant: https://twitter.com/amiritecom And if you type Amirite.com and Amirite.net into google this brings more than 5 million results. This is significant.

Is there any chance you might re-consider your vote since this is my first article and it would be a shame to have it deleted, especially sinc I really hope it isn't since I'm a big fan of Amirite,

Best Regards,

Philip Craddock1",0

""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf
