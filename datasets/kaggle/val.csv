Hi David,

I am nearing the end of this feingold Diet page project now, so I hope you are ready to go over it and fix anything I did wrong.

When the bot tells you that a vandal is a school IP, that should usually set alarm bells ringing.

 Discussion about this? 

The pages starts with """"Since Commons is a repository for free images that can be used across wiki and cross-project, wikipedia should move all its Free images to commons."""" - some people would dispute this, or rather, would dispute the deletion of the Wikipedia image. Was there a wide discussion of this bot and how it should operate? Could you link to that discussion from the top of the page?  
the content of the page is a personal essay and a simple description of what the bot does. It its been wikipedia's policy to delete images once they are on commons.

Heya,  is adding a lot of spam to various articles like Sengunthar, Mudaliar, etc. I engaged him in discussion and proved him wrong at least 3 times. I believe he also uses aliases and alternate accounts like  and . Also, he spawns duplicate articles like Chola and sengunthars (a dupe of Sengunthar).

First off, I'm a faggot - not an article creator. I've received good ass in my work as a truck stop cocksucker, while stealing the prose and research of others. Cocksucking is, in my mind, the best feature of Wikipedia. My faggoty tastes are eclectic, but all end in a jizz shoter. I can bounce ten cocks all over the place. I've spent time sucking off Kim Kardashian, vandals and BBM in Richard Gere's asshole and Richard Simmons's asshole, and assisted in the development of a faggoty article on the jizzmaster himself, me, (the latter of which has since undergone faggoty tranny surgery and a tit job. Further revisions to my cock include trying to fuck my mother with it, which I am not entirely happy about, but heck, it's a mom I remind you all I am a faggot who wouldn't risk pissing with the seat down, so you can tell my nickname is a faggoty attempt to appear edgy.

Maol Rubha is a redirect to the Wiki article Maol Rubha which starts: """"Máel Ruba (pronounced /mail Ruva/), ... Maol Rubha (MoRubha/MaRuibhe) (Scottish Gaelic spelling)"""" and is about the saint not the battle.  Can someone confirm they are one and the same man, and make an appropriate judgement please?  I'm aware of local sensibilities and as a Sassenach don't wish to tread on toes!  Meanwhile I've redone the wikification on St. Maol Ruadh to go straight to Maol Rubha.   """,0

Destructuring of the article
Ladies and gentlemen, apart from painful neutrality issue, I'm concerned with the growing deformation of the article's structure and style. I'm talking mainly about the actions of the definite national group of editors (which I could avoid naming unless it renews its usual personal attacking again).

Two weeks ago I removed the duplicating and excessicely-detailed sentences, as well as irrelevant images from """"Ukraine"""" section, and the other side seemed to agree non-images edit. Now I find new duplicating passages in the first section (although the intro looks better now). Editors who responsible for this: did you care reading section in the whole? And more, new lenghty redundant subsection on Vitebsk appeared. Not to mention the images, which litter only """"Ukraine"""" section (is this a permanent trollish attack on Ukrainian editors?).

Why doing things like that? I can understand POV-pushing intentions of pro-partisans users... But we must first of all care about innocent readers, not concerned with survival of either Russia or Ukraine. Otherwise the project would degrade, and Jimbo would run out of his budget.

The 'gender gap' will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on. The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people. The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women, such as ill-conceived politeness, will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done. ~~~~",1

 Supercategories 

Hi Daniel

I just noticed on the Mariners article seems to have a couple of super-categories, Sport in NSW is a supercat of Football (soccer) in NSW, and Australian football (soccer) teams is a supercat of A-League teams.  It's a minor point but are the supercats necessary if you've already identified more specific cats?   
Ah, yes, you raise a very good point. I must say, categories have never been my strong point; the best example was Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/FIFA World Cup hat-tricks, when I submitted it to FLC without even adding them (I forgot about their existance totally). I have modified the article, as (from my limited category knowledge) you are quite correct. Cheers, and thanks so much for this note, all your other suggestions, and your minor fixes, '''' """,0

 an incident has occurred within the church involving some type of sexual scandal. There is a discussion between the churches ip and members of Wikipedia if this  Between 1984 and 1989 John Langworthy was a youth minister at Prestonwood Baptist Church. On January 22nd, 2013, Langworthy pled guilty to five of eight felony counts of gratification of lust against young boys, receiving a suspended sentence of 50 years. He was also required to register as a sex offender. The offences occurred at Morrison Heights Baptist Church in Clinton, MS.[11] It was reported that Langworthy also admitted, in a pulpit confession, to prior sex offenses at Prestonwood Baptist Church. Some of the alleged victims made complaints to Prestonwood Church at the time, which were dealt with internally by church officials.[12] There are now allegations that Prestonwood Baptist Church covered up Langworthy's offenses by failing to report them to the proper authorities.

""":Also, I don't want to slow you down on FA, but it sounds like you're thinking about heading there after a final copyedit and some additional references. I would suggest waiting for a bit, as the article still seems pretty choppy to me. I took a stab at the navigation section tonight, rearranging sentences for paragraph flow, but didn't get very far without doing additional research. The article is comprehensive and duly referenced but I think it's still missing the elegant narrative that characterizes a feature article (""""prose is engaging, even brilliant, and of professional standard""""). Because it's been written by so many editors over many years, it feels a bit pieced together, and I think we have some work to do in creating an engaging narrative about the river. Missing citations, etc., are something we can deal with during the FA review, but I think it may help to work on the general flow of the article before going up for FA. I'll help out as I can...

 Attitude towards Christians

His teammates went on a one-day strike, then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didn't. Cobb did not escape suspension, he served it. The allegations against Cobb and Speaker in the mid-1920s came from another ballplayer, about a game several years earlier. It was that one player's word against theirs, hence insufficient evidence. Landis didn't hesitate to punch out the big stars (like Ruth) when it seemed warranted. The stats for Jackson in the '19 Series don't suggest he did anything much to help his team win. I don't know that he denied throwing the Series, some sources claim that. But did he keep the money? Far as I know, he did.

"""(unindent) As Steve points out, the notion that Greek astronomy influenced Indian astronomy is well-established.  This is moreover backed by a plethora of sources . Only Hindu-nationalist chauvinists contest this.  That the idea of a spherical source arrived to India from Greece is not ridiculous, it is well-sourced to the most reliable of sources (Pingree, David """"Astronomy and Astrology in India and Iran"""" Isis, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Jun., 1963), pp. 229-246).  What's ridiculous are your empty, original-research denials.  As for the fact that Yavanajataka specifically means """"Sayings of the Greeks"""", again that is reliably sourced (David Pingree, """"Jyotiḥśāstra"""", Jan Gonda (ed) A History of Indian Literature, Vol, VI Fasc. 4, Otto Harrassowitz - Wiesbaden, 1981) and .  As for the Yavanesvera, that too is a Alexandrian Greek text that was introduced into India, and that too, is sourced .  And please don't use crap like this [ , it only serves to undermine your credibility further.  Now, I am going to reintroduce into the lead that Indian astronomy was influenced by Greek astronomy, and I expect you to abide by that.

New questions

1) Why is criticism consistantly ahead of tradition in all of the entries? How do people know what is being criticised if they haven't heard of the tradition yet?

For instance, why is """"Dating and content"""" AFTER """"Historical accuracy?"""" Doesn't one have to have an idea when the book is written and what people say the book is about before you can cricize its accuracy?

2) What is the sole Adventist position on """"Literary structure"""" doing here, instead of an a """"Chiasm"""" page, with a link to there?

3) Shouldn't the """"Unity of Daniel"""" section be fused into the introduction, since they are saying nearly the same thing.

4) What is the """"Traditional Tomb Sites"""" section doing here if there is already a page for it, and the subject relates to the life of Daniel (the """"Daniel"""" page), and has little to nothing to do with the """"Book of Daniel"""" page?

Oliver Nicholson points out that, in contrast to the better known luminiferous aether of the 19th century, the older concept of the classical aether had three properties. Among these characteristics, the classical aether had a non-material property, was """"less than the vehicle of visible light"""", and was responsible for """"generating metals"""" along with fostering the development of all bodies.

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

Perhaps I seem to be repeating myself as you are repeatedly ignoring what I'm writing. The tables are unclear as the order of the product is unclear from them. E.g. the top-right corner of the first table is e6. But does that mean e1 × e7 = e6 or e7 × e1 = e6 ? It would not matter if the product is commutative but as it's not the tables are ambiguous. That is why tables are a very poor way to show the product, and probably why none of the sources use them.
And again please read MOS:LEAD in paticular the section on providing an accessible overview. Or look at the articles already mentioned, Special relativity and Cross product.

Generally speaking, a personal site isn't accepted as the only mark of somebody's notability.  A lot of people have personal sites, and they aren't notable for it.  The best thing to do would be to find a couple of other sources about Hammond, talking about his project, and link those; newspaper articles work, as do gallery notices and exhibit reviews.  If you have some kind of print source - an exhibition notice, or a catalogue with a bio - cite that as well.  It's not as easily checked, but it's usually a good mark of notability.

There's also coverage in a book (coffee-table type granted, but'd be a few paragraphs on the person & seems to be independent/legit at least).

You seem to have a strong POV against the CIA...in any case, shouldn't readers be allowed to decide for themselves?
It does.
What's the difference?
Facts are not POV.  The fact of the matter is, the NLG supported a highly anti-American and anti-Israeli document.  Take that as you like.
So you're saying that the facts make you think the NLG supports terrorism?  Not my problem.
I disagree.

 SynaptiCAD article deletion 

It's a little bit hard to dispute the notability of an article for deletion when it gets tagged for speedy deletion within 6 or 7 hours of it's initial posting. I spent about 4 hours writing that article, so it's somewhat disheartening to have it deleted so summarily. As for an administrator deleting a previous article about SynaptiCAD in the past, I have no idea what that article said, or why it was deleted. I've read the article on notabilty and I am certain I can find """"secondary sources"""" other than press releases about SynaptiCAD, but it would be nice if I could get the source back for the article to make appropriate modifications. Is there anyway to do that?

Yes, this is my best answer. If you re-read my message carefully without your “emotional victimisation”, you will find my answer to your question. I understand in lack of proper answer to the request by uninvolved editor to provide sources backing your argument of denying a massacre, you decided to send a sentimental message. The reason discussion went nowhere is that you are trying to divert the attention from the actual discussion and keep slandering neutral sources and authors in an attempt to disqualify them, while so far you haven’t provided any firm counter source. 
Moreover, we have RfC open and we have a neutral person who responded the RfC. You should ask your questions on the board of RfC to be transparent instead of canvassing and posting here selective messages. 
At this stage, the best we can do is to provide here the requested information, so that a person who mediates would make his/her conclusion.

{{Mergeto|Watercraft|date=November 2009}}

Can watercraft be merged with boat in order to simplify the articles (boat, boating, ship, watercraft) and provide a more clear article (with 1 meaning for each) ? Would allow to add more specific and better information for each rather than give a general view/modification of text for each individual article.

Also, boating can then be described as the activity of moving a watercraft over water (something which is hard if it were only to describe boats)

Definition should also be changed to A watercraft or boat is ... 
  
""""Watercraft"""" is a broader category of conveyances which enable passage across water, compared to """"boat.""""  Watercraft includes personal watercraft, which is the generic name for jet-skis and waverunners, as well as canoes and other gizmos such as this.

Germany and Austria have very limited protection for freedom of expression.  France is much the same, except that penalties tend to be less extreme.  England also has quite limited protection.  In fact, the concept """"freedom of speech"""" is barely understood, let alone respected, in Western Europe, despite much pretentious posturing.  And before Americans get on a high horse about it, they should bear in mind that a high level of legal protection was only reached in 1964, in a Supreme Court decision in a case involving Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement.

There are many illusions about these topics.

An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject.

This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.

I think you are both right. An ethnic group is a group of people with a subjective belief in a common descent (or if you like the perception of a common descent). To be an ethnic group a group does not have to have an actual common descent, only the belief in a common descent. There's also the meaning of descent, in anthropology descent does not by necessity have have to have a biological reality, some ethnic groups claim a common descent from gods, or totems. So I think that the English certainly are an ethnic group/nation because they have a perceived common ancestry.   09:25, 16",0

 Removed passage 

I removed this passage from the history section:
Currently, the Kachin Independence Organization is supporting the Burmese regime's sham National Convention. While the KIO in private does not believe that elections will ever happen, its agreements with the government have led to what it considers a better situation than the alternative of continued war. In public, the KIO is hoping to participate in future election after constitution has completed that guaranteed Burmese military regime 25% of reserved seats in central puppet government, according to Gauri Zau Seng, vice-Chairman of KIO/KIA.
Right or wrong, it's obviously, egregiously  not NPOV, as well as being totally unsourced. I don't doubt that there are other examples in the article, but this was the most flagrant. · rodii · """,0

Thanks for your kind comments on my talk page. Maybe I'll return to discuss about Stuart and to writing this article but certainly not in the situation when the one side is not a constructive partner for discussion. It's simply wasting of time. As I've already said in that discussion, my private opinions about homosexualism would probably be not very different from that of Sceptik, but I'm not engaged in wikipedia to conduct any ideological war or to abuse the people who don't agree with me, but to look for a truth and to deliver it to the readers in my articles. When someone has no respect for the truth, is not interested in looking for the truth, and abuses his adversaries, there's no sense to discuss with him.   19:40, 10 August 2008 (CET)",0

Hi Paul, I saw that you recently created Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Paul2387 4. You haven't transcluded it yet, so it isn't """"live"""". Can I suggest that you reconsider applying again right now? I mean this in the best possible way; your heart's in the right place, and you want to help out at Wikipedia, but you're seriously very unlikely to succeed right now.

Hello Sir, I wanted to create a page on Mr. Ziauddin Yousafzai, father of Malala Yousafzai. But am unable to create a page on Ziauddin Yousafzai as now it is a redirect. Could you kindly remove the redirect so as to enable to create an article about him. 

Ok, the reason for the need of creation of an article on him is that now he has been appointed as United nation's Special advisor/envoy on Global Education  http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7AmAud6bJ1of9J1fnfNfPN/Malalas-father-named-UN-advisor-on-education.html and also Pakistan’s education attache in Birmingham. http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Europe/Diplomatic-role-for-Malala-s-dad/Article1-984617.aspx So IMHO, this makes him very much notable figure and as he has been nominated for the post of UN envoy, a page on him is feasible and needed.

John S. Pemberton's father was James C. Pemberton, who was born about 1803-1806 in either North Carolina or South Carolina, according to the 1850 and 1860 census records. General John Clifford Pemberton's father and mother were not married until 1812 in Pennsylvania, according to Colonial and Revolutionary Families of Pennsylvania (published 1978 by the Genealogical Publishing Company). Therefore, it is very unlikely that James C. Pemberton is a brother of General John Clifford Pemberton. James was born before the marriage and in a different state entirely. A tree someone put on a Rootsweb website with no sources cited is NOT a valid source for the family connections. Just because John S Pemberton is of the right age to be the nephew of John C. Pemberton, and they both fought on the Confederate side, and they both have the same last name, and they are both famous, does NOT make them related.",0

""""The Spanish name Parraleta has been chosen here as the prime name because it’s the name used in its likely place of origin, the Somontano region in the province of Huesca, north-east Spain (Casanova Gascón 2008), as suggested by Vacarel’s 1765 reference to it under the old synonym Parrel (Montaner et al. 2004). <...> Comparison of the DNA profiles of Tinta Caiada (Almadanim et al. 2004), cultivated in the Alentejo in Portugal, and Carenisca (Zecca et al. 2010), grown on the Italian island of Sardegna, and Salceño Negro (Ibañez et al. 2003) from Somontano with that of Parraleta (Martín et al. 2003) suggests that they are one and the same.""""

I am really disappointed with the dictatorship you Wikipedia administrators carry out.
In your particular case, you still want to imagine you are living in the Meiji era. Okinawa is NOT another country anymore; the Okinawan tongue is a dialect of Japanese, like it or not (it was established so by the government years ago, after carrying out extensive linguistic research, and realizing the grammar is the same) (Palau, Korean, and Ainu are clearly not related).
I can't understand how Wikipedia can let a soldier, a brutish animal without intelligence, closer to the neanderthal than to the homo sapiens, have more authority editing articles than an expert in the subject.
And you Americans are clearly the most retarded people on Earth. Now I see why Americans in Japan can only get the ugliest and most retarded women out there. Bitches who, if they don't marry a dumb American, will end up single forever.

It improves the article because it shows that Keith has FRAUDULENTLY presented himself as something OTHER than what he is.  It goes right to his character.

The real takeway? User Blaxthos will do ANYTHING to help cover for liberals. And he is a prolific editor at Wikpiedia. Ultimately this inclusion will stay because it's both newsworthy and speaks to  Olbermann's dishonestly.

 Clarification 

Posted from User talk:IZAK#Meshullam Gross  
Hi IZAK, thanks for that neat move of Nachlas Tzvi. Only two issues - one fairly significant.

1.If you want to be pedantic, he actually went by the English name of Herman Gross. Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.
2.Technically speaking and according to the information availible to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly able, but never accepted it.
Therefore, I deliberately refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, let alone the Haredi category. Off the point since he wasnt a Rabbi, I object to terming him """"Haredi"""" as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasnt even used. Indeed, by todays standards he may not have been """"Haredi"""" (whatever that irksome term means). Many thanks,  """,0

Thanks for your compliment about my sense of humor. Thanks also for your contributions to the entry on Chris Langan. As you probably know, this has been a fraught entry for a long time.

I think that together they form a clear picture of what has been occurring with this entry. The recent input by yourself and NightSky has assisted a difficult process in recent days. If you know all this already, forgive me for mentioning it.

Not necessarily.  I believe SD 2.0 has tighter electrical specifications than SD 1.x (such as lower voltage tolerances and higher current tolerances) so a SD 1.x device may, but would not necessarily, qualify as an SD 2.0 device.  It would need to be meet the electrical specs of SD 2.0 before it could be able to offically support SDHC and carry the SDHC logo.  It is possible that some SD 1.x devices will already meet this spec just because they were designed well from the start, but they would need to be tested to ensure they meet the SD 2.0 electrical spec and also have a firmware upgrade.  136.186.1.185  04:08, 1 July 2008",0

When an article is put up for deletion and discussed, the participants in the deletion debate judge the article on its worth/merits.

I'm not sure and will think about it. , I'm doubt anything could be written about the SNPU that we couldn't fit into the Svoboda article, and so I tend to agree with you.

I'm guessing you'd disagree with this.

Nevertheless, we might all agree that far-right politics are in flux right now in Ukraine, and I wouldn't be surprised if many go the most far-right elements around Svoboda are now attracted to Right Sector. ', isn't it true that the Social-National Assembly and Patriots of Ukraine were originally groups that came from the transformation of the SNPU into Svoboda? Now these groups helped form Right Sector.

I think the Svoboda article could be improved by writing about all of this, and incorporating the SNPU material as well. It'll be easier a year from now when more academic material has been written about the current situation in Ukraine. -  """,0

Neither of the names mean tuya, but I think the best translation of tuya might be Búrfell (which name many Icelandic mountains possess).  Best regards,",0

Next time you remove a section without first following procedures, I will have you permanently barred from Wikipedia.  I wrote the section and it is completely accurate an unbiased as reported.  You are a fool and a vandal and I will be closely monitoring your activities on anything I write.",1

 Incest 

I am pleased to hear you also dislike incest. This is not a personal opinion however. In the course of my research at Oxford University I can see clearly how sickening and harmful it is. This is no more a personal opinion """"the earth is flat"""". Does the fact that some people do believe the earth is flat make it a matter of opinion? Of course not. The harmful effects of incest are directly observable in exactly the same way. I think we need a third party opinion on this.

Well if you search for [""""genetic speriority"""" Schockley] you are hardly going to get a wide range of results. That is bias during the research process.
